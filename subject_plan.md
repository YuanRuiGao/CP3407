## subject plan

### week 3 - Create the basic interface of the cleaning app

The third week is the starting week of the project. This week, our main task was to design the basic interface and the framework of the code. However, our problem was that our team did not have a unified plan to confirm the interface design. Eventually, we decided to have a discussion at a certain time to determine the general appearance and design of the interface. As for the code part, it was relatively smoother. Our team members easily completed the basic app framework.

### week 4 - Order-related functions 

We began to enhance the actual functions of the app. We completed the design of the order sending and receiving functions as originally planned. The only problem was that they were not aesthetically pleasing and simple enough. Eventually, one member was responsible for beautifying and simplifying them, and we all approved of the result. 

### week 5 - networking functions



### week 6 - personal profile function

We added the personal profile function, but we found that the order posting function couldn't properly read the personal profile information, resulting in errors and bugs. Eventually, at the end of this week's weekend, our team members finally identified the error in the code and successfully fixed it.
