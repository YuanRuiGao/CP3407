## Iteration 1 [week 3 - week 6 ], start date: 2025/6/6 -->  2025/7/1

### Main Goal for Iteration-2

#### Deliver a functional core cleaner app that enables:

* Create the basic interface of the cleaning app, which is divided into employer users and cleaning worker users.

* Enable the app to issue and receive orders

* Enable the app to connect to the external network and make it available.

* Enable the app users to upload their own information, and display the detailed information of employers and cleaners on the hiring interface.

### week 3 - Create the basic interface of the cleaning app

The third week is the starting week of the project. This week, our main task was to design the basic interface and the framework of the code. However, our problem was that our team did not have a unified plan to confirm the interface design. Eventually, we decided to have a discussion at a certain time to determine the general appearance and design of the interface. As for the code part, it was relatively smoother. Our team members easily completed the basic app framework.

### week 4 - Order-related functions 

We began to enhance the actual functions of the app. We completed the design of the order sending and receiving functions as originally planned. The only problem was that they were not aesthetically pleasing and simple enough. Eventually, one member was responsible for beautifying and simplifying them, and we all approved of the result. 

### week 5 - networking functions

When we attempted to incorporate the network connection code, we found that it failed to be called successfully. After researching the information and consulting with AI, we finally managed to connect to the network successfully.

### week 6 - personal profile function

We added the personal profile function, but we found that the order posting function couldn't properly read the personal profile information, resulting in errors and bugs. Eventually, at the end of this week's weekend, our team members finally identified the error in the code and successfully fixed it.

## Iteration 2 [week 6 - week 9 ], start date: 2025/7/6 -->  2025/8/6

### Main Goal for Iteration-2

#### Deliver a functional core cleaner app that enables:

* The usability and stability of the app are ensured to prevent any special circumstances from causing it to be unusable.

* Connect the app to the notification function of the device

* The function for modifying and canceling orders

* The personalized minor functions for both parties ensure smooth communication between them.

### week 7 - fix bug 

When using the app on different devices, there would be situations where it would freeze. Due to the large amount of code, we made guesses to figure out which part was causing the problem. Eventually, we discovered that there was a conflict in one of the functions of the order interface. Finally, we fixed it.

### week 8 - notification function

There were no major issues at the code level, but the main problem was what information we should notify. We were worried that too much notification would affect the user experience. Eventually, it was streamlined to only notify the order information.

### week 9 -  modifying orders function and chat function

After being reminded by others, we realized that we didn't have the functions to cancel and modify orders. We added these functions and will confirm the operation with the users. Secondly, we added a chat function. This function troubled the classmates who were responsible for the code for a long time. Eventually, we worked together to complete the development of this function.
