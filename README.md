# Project planning BEFORE iteration-1
### Main Gold of the Application
   #### We plan to create a mobile phone-based house cleaning appointment software, which has two functions: user-oriented and employee-oriented.

####    For users, users can log in to store their house information locally and use the software to make an appointment with a nearby registered cleaning company for door-to-door service.

####    For employees (registered cleaning company staff), the function is to store employees' personal information and provide services to nearby users who have made an appointment through the software.

####    While completing the above functions, the software can also become a platform for direct communication between users and staff.
