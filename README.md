# Project planning BEFORE iteration-1
Main Gold of the Application
    We plan to create a mobile phone-based house cleaning appointment software, which has two functions: user-oriented and employee-oriented.

    For users, users can log in to store their house information locally and use the software to make an appointment with a nearby registered cleaning company for door-to-door service.

    For employees (registered cleaning company staff), the function is to store employees' personal information and provide services to nearby users who have made an appointment through the software.

    While completing the above functions, the software can also become a platform for direct communication between users and staff.
